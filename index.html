<h1>klay mu's quick guide to self-hosting</h1>
<p>
    This website is hosted on a <a href=
    "https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but if those aren't available where and when you are, a good alternative is the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/">Rock 64</a>. I also recommend some sort of external hard drive so you can hoard all the data you want.
</p>
<p>
    First, go ahead and install whatever flavor of linux you're going to use, I recommend <a href="https://www.armbian.com/">armbian</a>. If your setup is wireless, install 'avahi-daemon' to make it easier to connect over LAN.

    <pre>$ sudo apt install podman</pre>
    You may need to run podman as root. As of this writing, Armbian does not support rootless containers.
