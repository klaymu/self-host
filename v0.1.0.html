<h2>klay mu's quick guide to self-hosting</h2>
<p>
    This website is hosted on a <a href=
    "https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but if those aren't available where and when you are, a good alternative is the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/devices/single-board-computers/rock64/">Rock 64</a>. I also recommend some sort of external hard drive so you can hoard all the data you want.
</p>
<p>
    First, go ahead and install whatever flavor of linux you're going to use, I recommend <a href="https://www.armbian.com/">armbian</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TODO:</strong> Auto-mount the external drive at /data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TODO:</strong> Install and configure nginx web server.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TODO:</strong> Install podman and mariadb, and host a web app!
    <br>
    <em>Wait hang on can you even install podman on armbian? Is that in the repos? Testing is required.</em>
